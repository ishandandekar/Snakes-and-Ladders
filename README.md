## Snakes and Ladders
### Work in progress!!!
---
Hello and welcome,
This is the snakes and ladders game repository which uses python language's inbuilt libraries, data structures and functions.
The game takes the number of players as an input and sets up the board for the players. When the player reaches 100 he/she/they win the game!
The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 6 including 1 and 6 both as a value of dice.
